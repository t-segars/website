        <p>As a former Army air  traffic controller; quick thinking and problem solving on the fly is something that makes me tick inside. After nine years of Army air traffic control, I lost my flight physical and could no longer qualify to perform the duties. 

            From there I returned home to the Gulf Coast of Florida and bought a sailboat. During this time I started working for a company at the lowest level. Within a year at that company I found myself as their director of operations. For the next four years I found myself in different marinas everyday, eating great food, and spending more time on the water than I knew how to enjoy. 
        
             During my time at Freedom,  I was closely involved in the software that they used corporate wide. Being on the user and the administrative side of their software,  I started to look at home to optimize it for better client/user results. Before I knew it I was coding, and I was in love. 
        
            After some research and some goodbyes, I enrolled in Coding Dojos Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. Packed my stuff up and moved to Burbank. I am currently on my last days here, finishing with honors.
